= Rack::Geoip

A rack middleware component that handles simple geoip lookups.

== Installation

First you must have a GeoIP database installed. Currently the only backend support is the free one from
MaxMind (http://www.maxmind.com). So you must first install the C api bindings.

    $ wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/GeoIP.tar.gz
    $ tar xzf GeoIP.tar.gz
    $ cd GeoIP-1.4.6
    $ ./configure && make && sudo make install

To download the actual GeoLiteCity (free) database you can currently find it here (I like to place it in
a data sub-directory).

    $ cd data
    $ wget http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz
    $ gunzip GeoLiteCity.dat.gz

And finally install the gem

    $ gem install rack-geoip
    
== Usage

=== Basic Usage

    require 'rack/geoip'
    use Rack::Geoip
    run app

=== Using with Rails

Add this to your config/environment.rb

    config.gem 'rack-geoip'

And then in an initializer block

    config.middleware.use "Rack::Geoip",
      :db => 'data/GeoLiteCity.dat',
      :path => '/geoip/info'
      
=== Sample output

    $ curl http://localhost:9292/lookup?ip=8.8.8.8
    
    { "area_code":650,
      "city":"Mountain View",
      "postal_code":"94043",
      "country_code":"US",
      "latitude":37.4192008972168,
      "country_code3":"USA",
      "longitude":-122.057403564453,
      "country_name":"United States",
      "dma_code":807,
      "region":"CA" }

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Credits

I want to acknowledge the work done by Geoffrey Grosenbach (http://peepcode.com) on the sinatra-geoip gem which was the
inspiration for this.
